# 🧱 TUIX Core 0.1.0

> ⚠️ **ATTENTION:**  
> This version of the library is an **MVP (Minimal Viable Project)** release.  
> Many of the implemented functions exist in the codebase but are **not yet actively used**.  
> This version serves as the foundation for upcoming releases.
> P.S. Still in development! Refactoring whole project.

## 🧩 Overview

**TUIX** is a modular terminal UI engine inspired by web technologies.  
It introduces a **DOM-like component system**, a **layout engine**, and a **buffer-based rendering pipeline** for building structured and styled terminal interfaces.

---

## 🚀 Installation

You can install this library using:

```bash
pip install tuix-core
```

---

# ⚡ Example Usage

Even though this MVP version is limited, here’s a small example showing what it can currently do:

```python
from tuix.core import TuixEngine as Tuix

# Initialize the main application engine
app = Tuix()

# Create a new component of type "choice"
app.components.create(object_type="choice", object_id="choice")

# Set component properties
app.components.set_property(object_id="choice", param="label", value="Test")

# Define a list of choices with actions
app.components.set_property(
    object_id="choice",
    param="choices",
    value=[
        [
            {"name": "Test", "action": "pass"},
            {"name": "Test", "action": "pass"}
        ]
    ]
)

# Align the component to the center using margin mode
app.layout.margin_mode(object_id="choice", param=["margin_top", "margin_left"], mode="centered")

# Render the layout to the terminal
app.render.draw()
```

🖥️ This renders a simple `choice` component in the terminal, centered both vertically and horizontally.

# ⚙️ Future Plans

Both the `LayouEngine` and `RenderEngine` will be rewritten in upcoming versions to create a far more powerful and flexible structure(🤫 won’t spoil the details yet).
